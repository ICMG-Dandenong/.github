# Our Purpose
Emir Sultan Mosque aims to serve the growing Muslim population in Dandenong and surrounding regions. We strive to provide the community with high-quality services, especially for our youth. 

We want to be able to educate our brothers and sisters, promote wholesome community values and facilitate all members of the community to have a better understanding of Islam. Therefore, from birth to marriage, marriage to death, we want to serve our community in every way possible.

In addition to offering a place of worship, Emir Sultan Mosque conducts classes to educate children on Islamic essentials. Provides services to Muslims and broader communities, runs programs for the youth, and provides a space where social events are held.

# Our History
Emir Sultan Mosque was founded in 1991 as a place of worship for local Muslim families to educate their children on Islamic essentials. Originally the Mosque was purchased as a church and then adapted into a Mosque. However, over the years, the population of Muslims in the area increased dramatically. 

To keep up with the growth and demand for our services, we initiated a reconstruction project in 2012, including a new mosque. And additional buildings such as a community youth centre, funeral services and a wudhu area.

The new Mosque has an increased capacity for worshipers, suitable spaces for Islamic studies and a new wudhu.
